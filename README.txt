An Add-on for Mozilla Firefox

Download serialized DOM with a click, which should include changes 
within the page effected since loading e.g. by JavaScript.

Built version ready to install from
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-serialized-dom/ .

Made since Firefox 57 to replace the earlier Save Back to File from DOM 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-back-to-file-from-dom/
by using the newly constrained web extensions format.

A couple nice SVG example files to try it out with are linked from
http://srguiwiz.github.com/save-back-xpi/save-back-examples.html .

Build with web-ext https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-ext .
